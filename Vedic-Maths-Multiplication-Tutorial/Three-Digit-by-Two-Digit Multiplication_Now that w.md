# Three-Digit-by-Two-Digit Multiplication

Now that we know how to multiply a three-digit number by a three-digit
number, let us see an example of how we can multiply a three-digit number
by a two-digit number.
All we have to do is put a zero in front of the two-digit number, thereby
making it a three-digit number and then apply the vertically and crosswise
method to it.
We now take an example 321 √ó 42.

Step 1
We first put a zero in front of 42, making it a three-digit number 042,
and then we apply the vertically and crosswise sutra. We multiply 2 by
1 to get 2 in the unit‚Äôs place of our answer.
Step 2
We know the second step very well‚Äîcrosswise. Here we quickly
multiply (2 √ó 2) + (4 √ó 1) = 4 + 4 = 8. We put down 8 as our answer
digit in the ten‚Äôs place.
Step 3
The third step is the star step! We do (2 √ó 3) + (0 √ó 1) + (4 √ó 2) = 14.
We put 4 in the hundred‚Äôs place and carry over 1 to the next step.
Step 4
We just do crosswise here to arrive at the thousand‚Äôs place digit.
(4 √ó 3) + (0 √ó 2) = 12 + 1 (carry-over) = 13. We put down 3 in the
thousand‚Äôs place and carry over 1 to the next step.
Step 5
This is where we do our vertical step multiplying 0 by 3, which gives
We add the carry-over 1 to 0 giving us 1 as the final answer figure.
Our answer is 13482.
I hope that you enjoyed this chapter on multiplication the Vedic way!
Positive Affirmations in Mathematics
There is a lot of negative talk at school and in the environment around us,
which disturbs our self-confidence and our ability to do things. Some of
these remarks go like this:

You are good for nothing.
You are a fool.
You can‚Äôt do this sum right.
You are a failure.
You will always get bad grades in school and disappoint us.
These negative words affect our day-to-day life and they play like a video
over and over again in our mind. It is therefore important to build our self-
confidence in maths through something called Positive Affirmation
Exercises.
A positive affirmation basically means talking positive to ourselves. This
not only boosts our morale and confidence but it also ensures that we
achieve positive results in our academics.
Try saying these words to yourself:

I am a genius in maths.
I have got 100 per cent marks in maths.
I have a natural ability to learn maths.
At this point you may say,‚ÄòSir, I get only 50 per cent in maths. How can I
lie to myself?‚Äô
Well, firstly, you are not lying to yourself. It is a message to your brain
that you believe you are good at something. Just thinking that makes you
feel better and hence, your grades improve.
For example, tell yourself that you are the richest man in the world. Now
how does that make you feel? Good, right?
Imagine what you could do with all the money in the world!
In the same way, positive affirmations make you feel good and help you
achieve your results if you maintain a positive frame of mind.
Repeat these words five times each.

I have done the sums correctly and have got 100 per cent in maths.
I am doing maths sums in my mind.
I am a genius in mathematics and am a maths guru.
I am the best (feel good about it).
All my friends respect me for my mathematical skills.
Now try to take a sum, say for example, 98 √ó 97, which you just learnt.

Try to close your eyes and think about the method by which you could
solve this sum. See if you can get the correct answer by solving it in your
mind.
The correct answer is 9506.

# ‚ú® Notes: Vedic Multiplication ‚Äì 3-Digit √ó 2-Digit \& Positive Affirmations


***

## üîπ 1. Three-Digit √ó Two-Digit Multiplication

We already learned:

- 2-digit √ó 2-digit
- 2-digit √ó 1-digit
- 3-digit √ó 3-digit

Now let‚Äôs see: **3-digit √ó 2-digit** multiplication (using *Vertically \& Crosswise Sutra*).

### Key Idea:

- Write the 2-digit number as a 3-digit number by **prefixing 0**.
- Apply the **same 5-step rule** as in 3-digit √ó 3-digit multiplication.

***

### Example: \$ 321 √ó 42 \$

Convert: \$ 321 √ó 042 \$.

**Step 1: Vertical (Units √ó Units)**
\$ 2 √ó 1 = 2 \$. (Units place ‚Üí 2)

**Step 2: Crosswise**
$(2 √ó 2) + (4 √ó 1) = 4 + 4 = 8$. (Tens place ‚Üí 8)

**Step 3: Star Step**
$(2 √ó 3) + (0 √ó 1) + (4 √ó 2) = 6 + 0 + 8 = 14$.
Write 4, carry 1 to next step. (Hundreds place ‚Üí 4)

**Step 4: Crosswise (Thousands place)**
$(4 √ó 3) + (0 √ó 2) = 12$. Add carry 1 ‚Üí 13.
Write 3, carry 1 to final step.

**Step 5: Vertical (Hundreds √ó Hundreds)**
$(0 √ó 3 = 0)$. Add carry 1 ‚Üí 1.

Final Answer = **13482** ‚úÖ

## üîπ 2. Positive Affirmations in Mathematics

### Why Affirmations in Maths?

- Students often hear negative comments:
    - "You are a fool"
    - "You will fail"
    - "You can‚Äôt do maths"
- Repeated negativity reduces confidence and gets stuck in the mind.


### Affirmations ‚Üí Reverse the Effect

- **Positive affirmations = positive self-talk.**
- Boosts self-belief and performance.

***

### üåü Examples of Positive Affirmations to Repeat 5 Times Each

1. I am a genius in maths.
2. I have got 100% in maths.
3. I have a natural ability to learn maths.
4. I am doing sums in my mind with ease.
5. I am the best in maths.
6. My friends respect me for my skills in maths.

***

### Example Mental Exercise:

**Problem:** \$ 98 √ó 97 \$

Think step-by-step (Base = 100, below base case):

- Deviations: \$ 98 ‚Üí -2\$, \$ 97 ‚Üí -3\$.
- Cross-subtract: \$ 98 - 3 = 95\$.
- Multiply deviations: $(-2) √ó (-3) = +6 ‚Üí 06$ (two digits since base = 100).
- Answer = **9506** ‚úÖ

**Affirmation Practice:**

- Close your eyes. Repeat affirmations.
- Visualize solving sums mentally \& getting correct results.

***

# ‚úÖ Summary

### 3-digit √ó 2-digit Multiplication:

- Write smaller number with a leading zero.
- Apply the **Vertically \& Crosswise 5-step method**.
- Example: \$ 321 √ó 42 = 13482 \$.


### Positive Affirmations in Maths:

- Replace negative self-talk with powerful affirmations.
- Examples: *‚ÄúI am a genius in maths‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can solve sums in my mind.‚Äù*
- Builds confidence ‚Üí improves performance.

üëâ Would you like me to now prepare a **one-page master sheet of all multiplication cases** (Below Base, Above Base, Above+Below Base, Multiples/Sub-Multiples, Vertically-Crosswise), so you have everything at a single glance for quick revision?
