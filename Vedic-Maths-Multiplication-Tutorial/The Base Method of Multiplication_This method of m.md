# The Base Method of Multiplication

This method of multiplication is used to multiply numbers very close to
powers of 10, like 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and so on.

In the beginning, we learn the fundamentals, so we stick with single-digit
figures; but as soon as we master multiplying single-digit figures we will
move on to solving double-digit and triple-digit figures as well.

So letâ€™s kick off with the sum 9 Ã— 8. Now we all know that the answer is 72

Step 1:
The first thing to note is that both the numbers are very close to 10. So
our base becomes 10.

9 is less than 10 by 1. So we write -1 on the right-hand side. Similarly,
for 8 we write -2 because 8 is less than 10 by 2.

Step 2:
Now that the sum is laid out, we apply our first rule which is: we add
or subtract crosswise as the sign may be. Therefore we subtract here
because the sign is a minus. So we do 9 - 2 = 7. We may also do 8 - 1 =
Both give us the first left-hand digit 7.

TIP: Here we have a choice to either do 9 - 2 or 8 - 1 = 7, whichever is
easier. Take your call.

Step 3:
In our final step, we apply the second rule: multiply vertically on the
right-hand side. So here we multiply -1 and -2, which gives us +2.
We then place 2 in the unitâ€™s column and we have our final answer 72.

We now take an important single-digit multiplication problem. Say we have
to multiply 7 Ã— 6. Hereâ€™s how you do it:
We first lay out the sumâ€”just the way we have learnt now.

Step 1
Both the numbers are close to the base of 10. 7 is less than 10 by 3.
And 6 is less than 10 by 4. Therefore, we write -3 and -4 at their
relevant positions.
Step 2
We now apply the first rule: add or subtract crosswise as the sign
may be. 7 - 4 is 3. We could also do 6 - 3, giving us 3 as the first digit
of our answer.
Step 3
We multiply vertically on the right-hand side of the problem. -3 times
-4 equals 12. Now here we apply our important placement rule,
because we have two digits. The placement rule says that if the base
hasâ€˜nâ€™ number of zeroes, there will be n number of digits on the
right-hand side. In this case, it means that, since our base 10 has one
zero, there will be only one digit on the right-hand side. Any extra
digits will be carried forward.
So here we have 12 on the right-hand side. We let 2 remain in the
unitâ€™s place and carry over 1 to the left and add to 3. 3 + 1 = 4, which
becomes our tenâ€™s place. So our final answer is 42.
NOTE: This placement rule can be applied to all other bases like 100,
1000, 10000, etc., as we will see.

You want me to convert the Base Method of Multiplication explanation into clear **study notes**, with **steps, rules, and worked-out examples**.
Hereâ€™s the nicely structured version:

# âœ¨ Notes on the **Base Method of Multiplication**

This is a shortcut method (from Vedic Mathematics) used to multiply numbers **close to powers of 10** (like 10, 100, 1000, â€¦). It uses a **base number** (the nearest power of 10) and works with **deviations** from that base.

***

## ðŸ”¹ General Steps

1. **Choose the Base**
Identify the nearest power of 10 (10, 100, 1000, â€¦) to both numbers.
2. **Find Deviations**
Write how much each number is **less than or greater than** the base (these may be negative or positive).
3. **Cross-Subtract (or Add)**
Subtract crosswise (or add if deviations are positive). This gives the **left-hand part** of the answer.
    - Either: first number â€“ deviation of the second
    - Or: second number â€“ deviation of the first
4. **Multiply Deviations**
Multiply the deviations vertically. This gives the **right-hand part** of the answer.
5. **Placement Rule**
    - If the base has `n` zeroes, the right-hand side must contain exactly `n` digits.
    - Extra digits get **carried over** to the left-hand side.

***

## ðŸ”¹ Example 1: \$ 9 Ã— 8 \$

- **Base:** 10
- Deviations: 9 â†’ -1, 8 â†’ -2
- Step 3 (cross-subtract): \$ 9 - 2 = 7 \$ (or \$ 8 - 1 = 7 \$)
- Step 4 (multiply deviations): $(-1) Ã— (-2) = 2$
- Step 5 (placement): Base = 10 â†’ 1 zero â†’ right part must have 1 digit â†’ "2" is okay here.

âœ… Final Answer = **72**

***

## ðŸ”¹ Example 2: \$ 7 Ã— 6 \$

- **Base:** 10
- Deviations: 7 â†’ -3, 6 â†’ -4
- Step 3 (cross-subtract): \$ 7 - 4 = 3 \$ (or \$ 6 - 3 = 3 \$)
- Step 4 (multiply deviations): $(-3) Ã— (-4) = 12$
- Step 5 (placement): Base = 10 â†’ 1 zero â†’ right part must have 1 digit.
    - So write 2, and carry over 1.
    - Left part = \$ 3 + 1 = 4 \$.

âœ… Final Answer = **42**

***

## ðŸ”¹ Placement Rule Recap

- **Base 10 (1 zero)** â†’ right-hand side has 1 digit.
- **Base 100 (2 zeros)** â†’ right-hand side has 2 digits.
- **Base 1000 (3 zeros)** â†’ right-hand side has 3 digits.
(and so on)

Carry over any extra digits into the left-hand side.

***

## âœ… Key Takeaways

- Works best when numbers are close to powers of 10.
- Only needs **subtraction + a small multiplication** of deviations.
- Cross-subtraction ensures speed.
- Pay careful attention to **placement and carrying rule**.
