# ✨ Notes on the **Base Method of Multiplication**

This is a shortcut method (from Vedic Mathematics) used to multiply numbers **close to powers of 10** (like 10, 100, 1000, …). It uses a **base number** (the nearest power of 10) and works with **deviations** from that base.  

***

## 🔹 General Steps
1. **Choose the Base**  
   Identify the nearest power of 10 (10, 100, 1000, …) to both numbers.  
   
2. **Find Deviations**  
   Write how much each number is **less than or greater than** the base (these may be negative or positive).  

3. **Cross-Subtract (or Add)**  
   Subtract crosswise (or add if deviations are positive). This gives the **left-hand part** of the answer.  
   - Either: first number – deviation of the second  
   - Or: second number – deviation of the first  

4. **Multiply Deviations**  
   Multiply the deviations vertically. This gives the **right-hand part** of the answer.  

5. **Placement Rule**  
   - If the base has `n` zeroes, the right-hand side must contain exactly `n` digits.  
   - Extra digits get **carried over** to the left-hand side.  

***

## 🔹 Example 1: $$ 9 × 8 $$
- **Base:** 10  
- Deviations: 9 → -1, 8 → -2  
- Step 3 (cross-subtract): $$ 9 - 2 = 7 $$ (or $$ 8 - 1 = 7 $$)  
- Step 4 (multiply deviations): $$(-1) × (-2) = 2$$  
- Step 5 (placement): Base = 10 → 1 zero → right part must have 1 digit → "2" is okay here.  

✅ Final Answer = **72**

***

## 🔹 Example 2: $$ 7 × 6 $$
- **Base:** 10  
- Deviations: 7 → -3, 6 → -4  
- Step 3 (cross-subtract): $$ 7 - 4 = 3 $$ (or $$ 6 - 3 = 3 $$)  
- Step 4 (multiply deviations): $$(-3) × (-4) = 12$$  
- Step 5 (placement): Base = 10 → 1 zero → right part must have 1 digit.  
   - So write 2, and carry over 1.  
   - Left part = $$ 3 + 1 = 4 $$.  

✅ Final Answer = **42**

***

## 🔹 Placement Rule Recap
- **Base 10 (1 zero)** → right-hand side has 1 digit.  
- **Base 100 (2 zeros)** → right-hand side has 2 digits.  
- **Base 1000 (3 zeros)** → right-hand side has 3 digits.  
(and so on)  

Carry over any extra digits into the left-hand side.

***

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Works best when numbers are close to powers of 10.  
- Only needs **subtraction + a small multiplication** of deviations.  
- Cross-subtraction ensures speed.  
- Pay careful attention to **placement and carrying rule**.

I’ll now turn your explanation of **Multiplying Above the Base** into **well-structured notes** with clear rules, step-by-step breakdowns, and all examples neatly arranged.

# ✨ Notes on Multiplication **Above the Base**

Until now, we multiplied numbers **below the base** (less than powers of 10).  
This method extends to numbers **above the base** as well (greater than 10, 100, 1000, etc.).  

It works quickly and can be done **mentally** using simple patterns.  

***

## 🔹 General Rules: Multiplying Above the Base
1. **Identify the Base**  
   Choose the nearest power of 10 (10, 100, 1000, …).  

2. **Find Excess**  
   Write how much each number is **above the base** (positive deviations).  

3. **Cross-Add**  
   Add crosswise, because the numbers are above the base.  
   - e.g., First number + excess of the second (or Second number + excess of the first).  
   - This gives the **left-hand part** of the answer.  

4. **Multiply the Excesses**  
   Multiply deviations vertically.  
   - This gives the **right-hand part** of the answer.  

5. **Apply the Placement Rule**  
   - If the base has $$n$$ zeroes, the right-hand part must contain exactly $$n$$ digits.  
   - Extra digits get carried over to the left-hand side.  

***

## 🔹 Examples (Base = 10)

### Example 1: $$ 12 × 13 $$
- Base = 10.  
- Excess: $$ 12 → +2$$, $$ 13 → +3$$.  
- Cross-add: $$ 12 + 3 = 15$$.  
- Multiply excesses: $$ 2 × 3 = 6$$.  
- Placement: Base = 10 → right side has 1 digit → "6".  

✅ Answer = **156**

***

### Example 2: $$ 18 × 19 $$ (carry case)  
- Base = 10.  
- Excess: $$ 18 → +8$$, $$ 19 → +9$$.  
- Cross-add: $$ 18 + 9 = 27$$.  
- Multiply excesses: $$ 8 × 9 = 72$$.  
- Placement: Base = 10 → right side must have 1 digit.  
   - So write "2" on the right, carry "7" to the left.  
   - Left part = $$ 27 + 7 = 34$$.  

✅ Answer = **342**

***

## 🔹 Squaring Above the Base (Base = 100)

This method is very powerful for squaring numbers just above 100.  

### Example 3: $$ 101^2 $$  
- Base = 100.  
- Excess = +01.  
- First part = $$ 101 + 01 = 102$$.  
- Second part = $$ 1^2 = 01$$ (must be 2 digits since base = 100).  

✅ Answer = **10201**

***

### Example 4: $$ 102^2 $$  
- Excess = +02.  
- First part = $$ 102 + 2 = 104$$.  
- Second part = $$ 2^2 = 04$$.  

✅ Answer = **10404**

***

### Example 5: $$ 103^2 $$  
- Excess = +03.  
- First part = $$ 103 + 3 = 106$$.  
- Second part = $$ 3^2 = 09$$ (two-digit format).  

✅ Answer = **10609**

***

### Example 6: $$ 108^2 $$  
- Excess = +08.  
- First part = $$ 108 + 8 = 116$$.  
- Second part = $$ 8^2 = 64$$.  

✅ Answer = **11664**

***

### Example 7: $$ 111^2 $$ (carry-over case)  
- Excess = +11.  
- First part = $$ 111 + 11 = 122$$.  
- Second part = $$ 11^2 = 121$$.  
   - Base = 100 → 2 digits only on RHS → take "21", carry over "1".  
   - Left part = $$ 122 + 1 = 123$$.  

✅ Answer = **12321**

***

### Example 8: $$ 112^2 $$  
- Excess = +12.  
- First part = $$ 112 + 12 = 124$$.  
- Second part = $$ 12^2 = 144$$.  
   - Write "44", carry "1" → left part = $$ 124 + 1 = 125$$.  

✅ Answer = **12544**

***

## 🔹 Base = 1000 Examples

### Example 9: $$ 1006 × 1009 $$  
- Base = 1000.  
- Excess: $$ +006, +009$$.  
- Cross-add: $$ 1006 + 9 = 1015$$.  
- Multiply excesses: $$ 6 × 9 = 54 → 054$$ (3 digits).  

✅ Answer = **1015054**

***

### Example 10: $$ 1008^2 $$  
- Excess = +008.  
- First part = $$ 1008 + 008 = 1016$$.  
- Second part = $$ 8^2 = 64 → 064$$.  

✅ Answer = **1016064**

***

## 🔹 The Algebra Behind the Method
The method works because of expansion:  

$$
(x + a)(x + b) = x(x + a + b) + ab
$$

Where:  
- $$ x = $$ base (10, 100, 1000, …)  
- $$ a, b = $$ excesses from the base  

This explains why cross-addition and excess multiplication give us the exact answer.

***

# ✅ Key Takeaways
- For numbers **above the base**, use **cross-addition** instead of subtraction.  
- Multiplying deviations gives the right part, always limited by the number of zeroes in the base.  
- Works equally well for multiplication and squaring.  
- Very efficient for mental calculation of squares above 100, 1000, etc.

# ✨ Notes on Multiplication **Above and Below the Base**  

We have learned:  
1. Multiplication of numbers **below the base**  
2. Multiplication of numbers **above the base**  

Now we extend it to:  
- Cases where **one number is above and the other is below the base**  
- Multiplication using **multiples or sub-multiples of base** (like 50, 200, etc.).  

***

## 🔹 General Rule (Above–Below Base Case)

1. **Identify the base** (nearest 10, 100, 1000…).  
2. **Find deviations**:  
   - Numbers above the base → positives  
   - Numbers below the base → negatives  
3. **Cross-add / cross-subtract**:  
   - Add the positive to the other or subtract the negative.  
   - This gives the **left-hand part** of the answer.  
4. **Multiply deviations vertically**:  
   - Positive × Negative = Negative.  
   - This gives the **right-hand part** of the answer.  
5. **Adjustment step** (important):  
   - Multiply the left-hand part by the base.  
   - Subtract the negative (deficiency product) from it.  

***

## 🔹 Examples

### Example 1: $$ 15 × 8 $$  
- Base = 10.  
- Deviations: $$ 15 → +5 $$, $$ 8 → -2 $$.  
- Step 2 (Cross): $$ 15 - 2 = 13 $$ (or $$ 8 + 5 = 13 $$).  
- Step 3 (Multiply deviations): $$ +5 × -2 = -10 $$.  
- Adjustment: Left = $$ 13 × 10 = 130 $$. Now $$ 130 - 10 = 120 $$.  

✅ Answer = **120**

***

### Example 2: $$ 17 × 9 $$  
- Base = 10.  
- Deviations: $$ 17 → +7 $$, $$ 9 → -1 $$.  
- Cross: $$ 17 - 1 = 16$$.  
- Deviation multiplication: $$ +7 × -1 = -7$$.  
- Adjustment: $$ 16 × 10 = 160$$. Subtract $$7$$.  

✅ Answer = **153**

***

### Example 3: $$ 102 × 99 $$  
- Base = 100.  
- Deviations: $$ 102 → +02 $$, $$ 99 → -01 $$.  
- Cross: $$ 102 - 1 = 101$$.  
- Deviation product: $$ 2 × -1 = -02$$.  
- Adjustment: $$ 101 × 100 = 10100$$. Subtract 02 → **10098**.  

✅ Answer = **10098**

***

### Example 4: $$ 1026 × 998 $$  
- Base = 1000.  
- Deviations: $$ 1026 → +26$$, $$ 998 → -2$$.  
- Cross: $$ 1026 - 2 = 1024$$.  
- Deviation product: $$ 26 × -2 = -52$$.  
- Adjustment: $$ 1024 × 1000 = 1024000$$. Subtract 52 → **1023948**.  

✅ Answer = **1023948**

***

## 🔹 Multiples & Sub-Multiples of Base  

We can also use working bases like **50, 200, 500**, etc.  
- Rule: Express working base in terms of a convenient power of 10 multiplied/divided by a factor.  
- After cross and deviation multiplication, **multiply the left-hand side by this factor** to adjust.  

***

### Example 5: $$ 44 × 48 $$ (near base 50)  
- Working base = 50 = $$10 × 5$$.  
- Deviations: $$ 44 → -6$$, $$48 → -2$$.  
- Cross: $$ 44 - 2 = 42 $$.  
- Product: $$ -6 × -2 = 12$$.  
- Adjustment: $$ 42 × 5 = 210$$.  
- Placement: Base = 50 (1 zero → RHS has 1 digit).  
   - From product 12 → take “2”, carry “1”.  
   - LHS = 210 + 1 = 211.  
   - Combined: **2112**.  

✅ Answer = **2112**

***

### Example 6: $$ 49 × 47 $$  
- Base = 50 = $$10 × 5$$.  
- Deviations: $$ 49 → -1$$, $$47 → -3$$.  
- Cross: $$ 49 - 3 = 46$$.  
- Product: $$(-1) × (-3) = +3$$.  
- Adjustment: $$ 46 × 5 = 230$$.  
- Placement: Base = 50 (1 zero → RHS = 1 digit). Final = **2303**.  

✅ Answer = **2303**

***

### Example (Further practice — suggested to try yourself)  
- $$ 198 × 202 $$ (Base 200)  
- $$ 48 × 53 $$ (Base 50)  
- $$ 495 × 505 $$ (Base 500)  

(Same method applies: find deviations, cross-add, multiply deviations, and adjust by factor.)  

***

# ✅ Summary Sheet  

- **Below the Base** → Use cross-subtract & positive products of negative deviations.  
- **Above the Base** → Use cross-add & positive products of positive deviations.  
- **Above & Below Base** → Cross-add becomes subtract, RHS negative → Adjust by multiplying LHS with base, subtract RHS.  
- **Multiples & Sub-multiples** → Adjust LHS by multiplying with the base factor (like ×5 for 50, ×2 for 200, ×0.5 for 500, etc.).

Let me now convert this entire section into **well-structured notes** with the **Multiples & Sub-Multiples idea**, the **different bases case**, and finally the **Vertically & Crosswise Sutra** for 2-digit × 2-digit, 2-digit × 1-digit, and 3-digit × 3-digit multiplication.  

***

# ✨ Notes on Multiplication (Multiples, Sub-multiples & Vertically-Crosswise)

***

## 🔹 1. Multiples & Sub-Multiples of Base  

Sometimes numbers are closer to **50, 200, 500**, etc., rather than 10, 100, 1000.  
We can still apply the **Base Method**, with a minor adjustment:  

### Rule:
- Write deviations from the **working base** (50, 200, …).  
- After cross-addition:  
  - Multiply LHS by the **factor between working base & nearest 10^n**.  
  - Handle RHS as per **placement rule**.  

***

### Example 1: $$ 44 × 48 $$ (near 50)  
- Working base = 50 = $$ 10 × 5 $$.  
- Deviations: $$ 44 → -6$$, $$ 48 → -2$$.  
- Cross: $$ 44 - 2 = 42$$.  
- RHS product: $$(-6) × (-2) = 12$$.  
- Adjustment: $$ 42 × 5 = 210$$.  
- Base 50 → one zero → RHS = 1 digit. From 12 → take "2", carry "1".  
- LHS = 210 + 1 = 211 → Final Answer = **2112**

***

### Example 2: $$ 49 × 47 $$  
- Base = 50 → factor 5.  
- Deviations: $$ -1, -3 $$.  
- Cross: $$ 49 - 3 = 46$$.  
- RHS: $$ -1 × -3 = +3$$.  
- LHS adjustment: $$ 46 × 5 = 230$$.  
- RHS = one digit → 3.  

✅ Answer = **2303**

***

## 🔹 2. Different Bases  

What if numbers are near **different bases**?  
- Example: 981 (near 1000) × 93 (near 100).  

### Rule:
1. Find the ratio: (Bigger base ÷ Smaller base).  
2. Multiply the smaller number by this ratio.  
3. Apply normal base method.  
4. Finally, divide the result by the same ratio.  

***

### Example 3: $$ 981 × 93 $$  
- Bases: 1000 (for 981), 100 (for 93).  
- Ratio = $$ 1000 ÷ 100 = 10 $$.  
- Adjust: $$ 93 × 10 = 930$$.  
- Compute: $$ 981 × 930 = 912330 $$.  
- Divide by 10 → **91233**  

✅ Answer = **91233**

***

### Example 4: $$ 1006 × 118 $$  
- Bases: 1000 & 100 → ratio = 10.  
- Adjust: $$ 118 × 10 = 1180$$.  
- Compute: $$ 1006 × 1180 = 1187080$$.  
- Divide by 10 → **118708**  

✅ Answer = **118708**

***

## 🔹 3. The Vertically & Crosswise Sutra  
This sutra allows us to multiply **any numbers**, mentally or on paper, using a visual pattern.  

***

### 📘 A. Two-Digit × Two-Digit  
**Steps:**  

1. **Vertical (units × units)** → gives RHS (units).  
2. **Crosswise (units×tens + tens×units)** → gives middle part.  
3. **Vertical (tens × tens)** → gives LHS.  

***

#### Example 5: $$ 12 × 43 $$  
- Step 1: Units → $$ 3 × 2 = 6$$.  
- Step 2: Cross → $$ (3 × 1) + (4 × 2) = 3 + 8 = 11$$. Write 1, carry 1.  
- Step 3: Tens → $$ 4 × 1 = 4$$. Add carry 1 → 5.  

✅ Answer = **516**

***

#### Example 6: $$ 78 × 69 $$  
- Step 1: Units → $$ 9 × 8 = 72$$. Write 2, carry 7.  
- Step 2: Cross → $$ (9 × 7) + (6 × 8) = 63 + 48 = 111$$. Add carry 7 → 118. Write 8, carry 11.  
- Step 3: Tens → $$ 6 × 7 = 42$$. Add carry 11 → 53.  

✅ Answer = **5382**

***

### 📘 B. Two-Digit × One-Digit  
Convert the one-digit into two-digits by prefixing a **0**.  

***

#### Example 7: $$ 34 × 8 $$  
- Write as $$ 34 × 08 $$.  
- Step 1: Units → $$ 8 × 4 = 32$$. Write 2, carry 3.  
- Step 2: Cross → $$ (8 × 3) + (0 × 4) = 24$$. Add carry 3 → 27. Write 7, carry 2.  
- Step 3: Tens Vertical → $$ 0 × 3 = 0$$. Add carry 2 → 2.  

✅ Answer = **272**

***

### 📘 C. Three-Digit × Three-Digit  
Pattern involves **5 steps**:  

1. **Vertical (units × units)**.  
2. **Cross (tens×units + units×tens)**.  
3. **Star step (hundreds×units + tens×tens + units×hundreds)**.  
4. **Cross (hundreds×tens + tens×hundreds)**.  
5. **Vertical (hundreds × hundreds)**.  

This follows a symmetric dot/star pattern — scalable to larger digits as well.  

***

# ✅ Key Takeaways
- **Multiples/Sub-multiples base** → Use the nearest flexible base (50, 200, 500, etc.), then adjust by factor.  
- **Different bases** → Scale smaller number, apply method, then divide back.  
- **Vertically & Crosswise Sutra** → Works for ANY multiplication (2-digit, 3-digit, larger), stepwise: Vertical → Cross → Star → Cross → Vertical.

# ✨ Notes: Vedic Multiplication – 3-Digit × 2-Digit & Positive Affirmations  

***

## 🔹 1. Three-Digit × Two-Digit Multiplication  

We already learned:  
- 2-digit × 2-digit  
- 2-digit × 1-digit  
- 3-digit × 3-digit  

Now let’s see: **3-digit × 2-digit** multiplication (using *Vertically & Crosswise Sutra*).  

### Key Idea:  
- Write the 2-digit number as a 3-digit number by **prefixing 0**.  
- Apply the **same 5-step rule** as in 3-digit × 3-digit multiplication.  

***

### Example: $$ 321 × 42 $$  

Convert: $$ 321 × 042 $$.  

**Step 1: Vertical (Units × Units)**  
$$ 2 × 1 = 2 $$. (Units place → 2)  

**Step 2: Crosswise**  
$$(2 × 2) + (4 × 1) = 4 + 4 = 8$$. (Tens place → 8)  

**Step 3: Star Step**  
$$(2 × 3) + (0 × 1) + (4 × 2) = 6 + 0 + 8 = 14$$.  
Write 4, carry 1 to next step. (Hundreds place → 4)  

**Step 4: Crosswise (Thousands place)**  
$$(4 × 3) + (0 × 2) = 12$$. Add carry 1 → 13.  
Write 3, carry 1 to final step.  

**Step 5: Vertical (Hundreds × Hundreds)**  
$$(0 × 3 = 0)$$. Add carry 1 → 1.  

Final Answer = **13482** ✅

## 🔹 2. Positive Affirmations in Mathematics  

### Why Affirmations in Maths?  
- Students often hear negative comments:  
  - "You are a fool"  
  - "You will fail"  
  - "You can’t do maths"  
- Repeated negativity reduces confidence and gets stuck in the mind.  

### Affirmations → Reverse the Effect  
- **Positive affirmations = positive self-talk.**  
- Boosts self-belief and performance.  

***

### 🌟 Examples of Positive Affirmations to Repeat 5 Times Each  

1. I am a genius in maths.  
2. I have got 100% in maths.  
3. I have a natural ability to learn maths.  
4. I am doing sums in my mind with ease.  
5. I am the best in maths.  
6. My friends respect me for my skills in maths.  

***

### Example Mental Exercise:  

**Problem:** $$ 98 × 97 $$  

Think step-by-step (Base = 100, below base case):  

- Deviations: $$ 98 → -2$$, $$ 97 → -3$$.  
- Cross-subtract: $$ 98 - 3 = 95$$.  
- Multiply deviations: $$(-2) × (-3) = +6 → 06$$ (two digits since base = 100).  
- Answer = **9506** ✅  

**Affirmation Practice:**  
- Close your eyes. Repeat affirmations.

## 1️⃣ BELOW THE BASE

- **When to use:** Numbers just below powers of 10/100/1000...
- **Steps:**
  1. Choose base. Find each number’s deficiency (write as negative).
  2. Cross-Subtract: (First – Second’s deficiency) OR (Second – First's deficiency) → LHS.
  3. Multiply deficiencies (neg × neg = pos) → RHS.
  4. Placement Rule: Base with n zeroes → RHS must have n digits.

- **Example:**  
  $$ 97 \times 96 $$, Base = 100 (–3, –4)  
  LHS: $$ 97 – 4 = 93 $$  
  RHS: $$ (–3) \times (–4) = 12 $$  
  **Answer: 9312**

***

## 2️⃣ ABOVE THE BASE

- **When to use:** Numbers just above powers of 10/100/1000...
- **Steps:**
  1. Find excess over base (write as positive).
  2. Cross-Add: (First + Second’s excess) → LHS.
  3. Multiply excesses → RHS.
  4. Placement Rule as above.

- **Example:**  
  $$ 104 \times 107 $$, Base = 100 (+4, +7)  
  LHS: $$ 104 + 7 = 111 $$  
  RHS: $$ 4 \times 7 = 28 $$  
  **Answer: 11128**

***

## 3️⃣ ONE ABOVE, ONE BELOW BASE

- **When to use:** One number above, one below the base.
- **Steps:**
  1. Find deviation for each (one positive, one negative).
  2. Cross: (First + Second’s deviation) OR (Second + First's deviation) → LHS.
  3. Multiply deviations (will be negative) → RHS.
  4. **Adjustment:** Final Answer = (LHS × Base) – |RHS|
     (Apply placement rule if necessary.)

- **Example:**  
  $$ 106 \times 94 $$, Base=100 (+6, –6)  
  LHS: $$ 106 – 6 = 100 $$  
  RHS: $$ 6 × (–6) = –36 $$  
  Final: $$ 100 \times 100 – 36 = 10000 – 36 = 9964 $$  
  **Answer: 9964**

***

## 4️⃣ MULTIPLES & SUB-MULTIPLES OF BASE (e.g., 50, 200, 500...)

- **When to use:** Numbers near 50, 200, 500, etc.
- **Steps:**
  1. Find working base. Write deviations.
  2. Cross (add/subtract) → LHS.
  3. Multiply deviations.
  4. **Adjust:** Multiply LHS by the factor (e.g., 5 if base is 50).
  5. Placement Rule: Working base (e.g., 50) with 1 zero → one digit for RHS; carry over if needed.

- **Example:**  
  $$ 49 \times 47 $$, Base=50 (–1, –3)  
  LHS: $$ 49 – 3 = 46 $$  
  RHS: $$ (–1) \times (–3) = 3 $$  
  Adjust: $$ 46 \times 5 = 230 $$  
  **Answer: 2303**

***

## 5️⃣ DIFFERENT BASES

- **When to use:** Each number near a different base (e.g., 1000 & 100).
- **Steps:**
  1. Find base ratio (larger ÷ smaller).
  2. Multiply smaller number by ratio.
  3. Apply usual base method.
  4. Divide final answer by ratio for answer.

- **Example:**  
  $$ 981 \times 93 $$, Bases=1000 & 100 → Ratio=10  
  Multiply: $$ 981 \times 930 = 912330 $$  
  Divide by 10:  
  **Answer: 91233**

## 6️⃣ VERTICALLY & CROSSWISE SUTRA  
(Universal method: Any digits × Any digits)

### 2-Digit × 2-Digit

- **Steps:**
  1. Units × Units   → rightmost digit.
  2. (Tens × Units) + (Units × Tens) → middle digit(s).
  3. Tens × Tens    → leftmost digit(s).

- **Example:**  
  $$ 34 \times 21 $$:  
  Units: $$ 4 \times 1 = 4 $$  
  Cross: $$ (3 \times 1)+(2 \times 4)=3+8=11 $$ (write 1, carry 1)  
  Tens: $$ 3 \times 2 = 6 $$ + carry 1 = 7  
  **Answer: 714**

### 3-Digit × 2-Digit

- **Steps:**  
  - Pad 2-digit number with leading zero (e.g., 42 → 042).
  - Apply the 5-step pattern (vertical, cross, star, cross, vertical).

- **Example:**  
  $$ 321 \times 42 $$: (as detailed previously)  
  **Answer: 13482**

### 3-Digit × 3-Digit

- **Pattern:** Vertical, Cross, Star, Cross, Vertical  
- *Refer to prior notes for detailed illustration.*

# Vedic Math Sutra: **"All from 9 and the Last from 10"**

***

## What does it mean?

When you subtract a number from a **power of 10** (like 10, 100, 1000, 10000...), instead of subtracting normally, you:

- Subtract **every digit except the last one** from **9**  
- Subtract the **last digit** from **10**

This makes subtraction faster, easier, and perfect for mental calculation.

***

## Step-by-Step Explanation:

Say you want to subtract a number $$ N $$ from the power of 10, $$ P $$.

**Example:** Subtract 78 from 100

1. Write the number as digits: 7 and 8  
2. Subtract every digit except the last from 9:  
   - $$ 9 - 7 = 2 $$  
3. Subtract the last digit from 10:  
   - $$ 10 - 8 = 2 $$  
4. Combine these results: 22  
5. So, $$ 100 - 78 = 22 $$

***

## More Examples

### Example 1: $$ 100 - 47 $$

- $$ 9 - 4 = 5 $$  
- $$ 10 - 7 = 3 $$  
- Answer: **53**

### Example 2: $$ 1000 - 367 $$

- Write $$ 367 $$ as $$ 0367 $$ to match 4 digits in 1000.  
- Subtract all but the last digit from 9:  
  - $$ 9 - 0 = 9 $$  
  - $$ 9 - 3 = 6 $$  
  - $$ 9 - 6 = 3 $$  
- Subtract last digit from 10:  
  - $$ 10 - 7 = 3 $$  
- Combine: **9633**  
- So, $$ 1000 - 367 = 633 $$ (Note leading 9 means borrowing has happened, final is 633)

***

## When to use?

- Always with numbers being subtracted from powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc.)
- Useful for fast mental subtraction and simplifying complex calculations.

## Summary

| Step                  | Operation                       | Result Example for 78 from 100 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Subtract digits from 9 | Subtract every digit except last from 9 | $$9-7=2$$                  |
| Subtract last digit    | Subtract last digit from 10     | $$10-8=2$$                    |
| Combine results       | Join digits together            | **22**                        |

***

This method drastically simplifies subtraction from powers of ten and is part of the core techniques of **Vedic Mathematics**.
