# Multiply Above the Base

So far we have been doing multiplications of numbers which are below the
base of 10, 100, 1000, etc. Now we will multiply numbers which are above
these bases.

When I had the opportunity to speak on Vedic maths at TED
Youth@New York, I chose the base method as it was by far the most
engaging of all the methods, since it could be done mentally. Students could
relate to it as, by applying
this method, they could just shout aloud the squares of numbers more than
100 or 1000. And it was nothing but just understanding a simple pattern
which I will share with you here.

Letâ€™s take a sum of, say, 12 Ã— 13.
We lay it out the same way as before.
Step 1
Here we write down the excess from the base instead of the
deficiencies. So 12 is more than the base 10 by 2, so we write +2 and
similarly for 13, we write +3, because 13 is more than 10 by 3.
Step 2
Now here we cross-add instead of cross-subtract as the numbers are
above the base. So we have 12 + 3 = 15, which is the first part of our
answer. We could also do 13 + 2 to arrive at 15.
Step 3
Now we multiply vertically, just as before. +2 Ã— +3 equals +6, which is
the final part of our answer. So our answer becomes 156.
This I think is pretty straightforward and can be done in one line mentally.
Letâ€™s take a carry-over sum, before moving on to doing squares of numbers
above 100 or 1000.

Say we have 18 Ã— 19. We lay the sum down just as before, like this:
Step 1
The base here is 10. So we write the excess from 10 on the right-hand
side. For 18, we write +8 and for 19, we write +9.
Step 2
We now cross-add and arrive at the first answer digit. 18 + 9 = 27. We
could also do 19 + 8 = 27.
Step 3
We now multiply vertically on the right-hand side. Eight times 9 is 72.
We now apply the placement rule. Since our base is 10 and 10 has only
one zero, there should only be one digit on the right-hand side. Any
other digit we add by carrying it over to the left side.
So here we take 7 to the left-hand side and add it to 27. 27 + 7 = 34.
And then 2 comes down, giving us the answer 342.
Now we come to the section you will absolutely love. We take the base 100
here. I will share with you the pattern and, once you understand that, you

will be able to work out squares more than 100, mentally.
Letâ€™s take the sum 101 Ã— 101. Here we lay out the sum just as before.

In this sum +01 is the excess from 100. So we write that on the right-
hand side.
Now try doing the sum mentally.

Step 1
Imagine you are now cross-adding. 101 + 01 = 102. This gives us the
first part of the answer.
Step 2
In this step, we multiply vertically, 01 by 01. This is nothing but
squaring the excess of 01. So 01 squared gives us 01, which is the
second part of our answer. So our complete answer is 10201.
Now you can do this mentally. Just find out the excess and add it to the
number which you are squaring. This will give you the first part of the
answer.
Now to get the final part of the answer, just square the excess. And you
have the answer.
Letâ€™s take another sum: 102 Ã— 102.
Try doing this sum absolutely mentally. Find out the excess and add it to
the number that is being squared. Finally, square the excess and you have
the answer!

Now say we have 103 Ã— 103. You try it first mentally and arrive at the
answer. Since you are only learning now, itâ€™s okay if you donâ€™t get it right.
See the solution only after you have got an answer.
So in the sum 103 Ã— 103, find out the excess which is +03.
Add 03 to 103. It gives us 106, which is the first part of the answer.
To get the second part of the answer, simply square 03. Thatâ€™s 09.
Combining this with the first part of the answer we get 10609, which is
our final answer.

Now try 108^2 in the same way. Your answer would be 11664.

Remember there will be sums which will have carry-overs too. Say, for
example, 111 Ã— 111.

In this sum 111 Ã— 111, the excess from the base of 100 is +11, which we
write at the appropriate place. We then add the excess to 111, which gives
us 122 as the first part of the answer.
Finally, we square the excess of 11 giving us 121. Here since the base is
100 and it has two zeroes, we will take 1 as the carry-over. We add 1 to 122,
giving us 123 and our answer becomes 12321.
We will do one more similar sum. Say, we have 1 122.

Step 1
The excess is +12. We add +12 to 112 giving us 124.
Step 2
Finally, we square the excess of 12. 12 Ã— 12 = 144. We apply the
placement rule and carry 1 to the left-hand side, adding to 124, and we
get 125.
So our final answer becomes 12544.
This was till base 100. Now let us see base 1000.

Say we have the sum 1006 Ã— 1009.

Step 1
We lay the sum out as before:
Step 2
The base is 1000 and the excess from 1000 is +006 and +009
respectively. We do cross-addition and get the first part of our answer.
1006 + 009 = 1015, or 1009 + 006 = 1015.
Step 3
We multiply vertically now. So 006 Ã— 009 gives us 054, which is the
second part of our answer. Our complete answer is 1015054.
Now that we know how a base 1000 sum looks, we can even start squaring
base 1000 problems with the same reasoning as the base 100 sums.
So for example, letâ€™s take the sum 1008 Ã— 1008.
Try doing this sum mentally on the same logic principle shared earlier.
The excess is +008, which is added to 1008 to give us 1016, which
becomes the first part of the answer.
To arrive at the second part of the answer, we simply square the excess.
So 008 squared is 064.
Combining the two parts, our answer becomes 1016064.

Let us now see the principle behind this maths sutra and why it works.

( x + a ) ( x + b ) = x ( x + a + b ) + ab
Here x is the base of 10, 100 or 1000, etc., and a and b are the excesses or
deficiencies from the base.

# âœ¨ Notes on Multiplication **Above the Base**

Until now, we multiplied numbers **below the base** (less than powers of 10).
This method extends to numbers **above the base** as well (greater than 10, 100, 1000, etc.).

It works quickly and can be done **mentally** using simple patterns.

***

## ðŸ”¹ General Rules: Multiplying Above the Base

1. **Identify the Base**
Choose the nearest power of 10 (10, 100, 1000, â€¦).
2. **Find Excess**
Write how much each number is **above the base** (positive deviations).
3. **Cross-Add**
Add crosswise, because the numbers are above the base.
    - e.g., First number + excess of the second (or Second number + excess of the first).
    - This gives the **left-hand part** of the answer.
4. **Multiply the Excesses**
Multiply deviations vertically.
    - This gives the **right-hand part** of the answer.
5. **Apply the Placement Rule**
    - If the base has $n$ zeroes, the right-hand part must contain exactly $n$ digits.
    - Extra digits get carried over to the left-hand side.

***

## ðŸ”¹ Examples (Base = 10)

### Example 1: \$ 12 Ã— 13 \$

- Base = 10.
- Excess: \$ 12 â†’ +2\$, \$ 13 â†’ +3\$.
- Cross-add: \$ 12 + 3 = 15\$.
- Multiply excesses: \$ 2 Ã— 3 = 6\$.
- Placement: Base = 10 â†’ right side has 1 digit â†’ "6".

âœ… Answer = **156**

***

### Example 2: \$ 18 Ã— 19 \$ (carry case)

- Base = 10.
- Excess: \$ 18 â†’ +8\$, \$ 19 â†’ +9\$.
- Cross-add: \$ 18 + 9 = 27\$.
- Multiply excesses: \$ 8 Ã— 9 = 72\$.
- Placement: Base = 10 â†’ right side must have 1 digit.
    - So write "2" on the right, carry "7" to the left.
    - Left part = \$ 27 + 7 = 34\$.

âœ… Answer = **342**

***

## ðŸ”¹ Squaring Above the Base (Base = 100)

This method is very powerful for squaring numbers just above 100.

### Example 3: \$ 101^2 \$

- Base = 100.
- Excess = +01.
- First part = \$ 101 + 01 = 102\$.
- Second part = \$ 1^2 = 01\$ (must be 2 digits since base = 100).

âœ… Answer = **10201**

***

### Example 4: \$ 102^2 \$

- Excess = +02.
- First part = \$ 102 + 2 = 104\$.
- Second part = \$ 2^2 = 04\$.

âœ… Answer = **10404**

***

### Example 5: \$ 103^2 \$

- Excess = +03.
- First part = \$ 103 + 3 = 106\$.
- Second part = \$ 3^2 = 09\$ (two-digit format).

âœ… Answer = **10609**

***

### Example 6: \$ 108^2 \$

- Excess = +08.
- First part = \$ 108 + 8 = 116\$.
- Second part = \$ 8^2 = 64\$.

âœ… Answer = **11664**

***

### Example 7: \$ 111^2 \$ (carry-over case)

- Excess = +11.
- First part = \$ 111 + 11 = 122\$.
- Second part = \$ 11^2 = 121\$.
    - Base = 100 â†’ 2 digits only on RHS â†’ take "21", carry over "1".
    - Left part = \$ 122 + 1 = 123\$.

âœ… Answer = **12321**

***

### Example 8: \$ 112^2 \$

- Excess = +12.
- First part = \$ 112 + 12 = 124\$.
- Second part = \$ 12^2 = 144\$.
    - Write "44", carry "1" â†’ left part = \$ 124 + 1 = 125\$.

âœ… Answer = **12544**

***

## ðŸ”¹ Base = 1000 Examples

### Example 9: \$ 1006 Ã— 1009 \$

- Base = 1000.
- Excess: \$ +006, +009\$.
- Cross-add: \$ 1006 + 9 = 1015\$.
- Multiply excesses: \$ 6 Ã— 9 = 54 â†’ 054\$ (3 digits).

âœ… Answer = **1015054**

***

### Example 10: \$ 1008^2 \$

- Excess = +008.
- First part = \$ 1008 + 008 = 1016\$.
- Second part = \$ 8^2 = 64 â†’ 064\$.

âœ… Answer = **1016064**

***

## ðŸ”¹ The Algebra Behind the Method

The method works because of expansion:

$$
(x + a)(x + b) = x(x + a + b) + ab
$$

Where:

- \$ x = \$ base (10, 100, 1000, â€¦)
- \$ a, b = \$ excesses from the base

This explains why cross-addition and excess multiplication give us the exact answer.

***

# âœ… Key Takeaways

- For numbers **above the base**, use **cross-addition** instead of subtraction.
- Multiplying deviations gives the right part, always limited by the number of zeroes in the base.
- Works equally well for multiplication and squaring.
- Very efficient for mental calculation of squares above 100, 1000, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to now also prepare a **combined NOTES sheet** where I cover **both Below-the-Base \& Above-the-Base** methods side by side, for quick revision?
