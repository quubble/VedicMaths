# Multiples and Sub-Multiples

I was at IIT Madras giving a talk at their technical fest, Shaastra, and
someone asked me this question: if two numbers are closer to 50 or 200 or
any other multiple of 10, can we still apply the base method?
What do you think the answer could be? Think for a moment or two!
My answer to that question isâ€˜yes!â€™ We can still apply the base method,
but with a minor adjustment.

Letâ€™s take an example and see how. Say we have to multiply 44 and 48,
two numbers near to the base 50.

Step 1
We lay out the sum just as before. And write the excesses and
deficiencies from our working base 50. So here we have 44, which is
less than 50 by 6, and 48, which is less than 50 by 2.
Step 2
We now cross-add or subtract as the case may be. So we have our left-
hand side as 44 - 2 = 42 or 48 - 6 = 42. We then multiply vertically -6
and -2 to get 12. Our sum now looks like this:
Step 3
Now since our working base is 50, we have to adjust the sum for this.
Since we get 50 by multiplying 10 and 5, we multiply 42 by 5 to get
210, which is the left-hand side of the answer.
Since our base is 50, which has one zero, the right-hand side should
have one digit. And since there is one digit extra, we add that to the
left-hand side.
210 + 1 = 211 and 2 comes down, giving us the answer of 2112.
Letâ€™s see some more illustrations of the same principle at work.
Say we have 49 Ã— 47.

Step 1
Our working base here is 50 as both 49 and 47 are near to it. Letâ€™s lay
the sum out and apply the rules learnt in the previous example. We also
write down the excesses or deficiencies as before.
Step 2
Now since the working base is 10 Ã— 5 = 50, we multiply the tenâ€™s place
by 5. So here we multiply 46 (in the tenâ€™s place) by 5. This gives us
230.
Step 3
Our final step will just be bringing the 3 down and combining it with
230 to make 2303.
Our final answer is 2303.
Let me give you three worked-out sums as illustrations.

Now that we have understood the concept of the working bases letâ€™s move
on to the final part of this base method. What happens when we have two
different bases as part of the problem?
For example, say we have 981 Ã— 93. How do we work this out?

Step 1
Find out the ratio of the bigger base to the smaller base. In this sum the
base of 981 is 1000 and the base of 93 is 100. So dividing the bigger
base by the smaller base we get 10. We multiply 93 by 10, giving us
930.
We now solve the sum 981 Ã— 930 in the usual base method way.
Step 2
981 Ã— 930 gives us 912330.
Because we multiplied 930 by 10, we divide the answer now by 10.
So 91233 is our answer figure.
Letâ€™s take another sum, this time 1006 Ã— 118.

Step 1
We find out the ratio of the bigger base to the smaller base. Once we
have done that we multiply the smaller number by it. So 118 Ã— 10 =
We now multiply 1180 and 1006.
Step 2
Multiplying 1180 Ã— 1006 using the base method gives us 1187080. We
now divide 1187080 by 10 giving us 118708 as our final answer.
We can now move on to a more general approach to multiplication. This is
a very important maths sutraâ€” vertically and crosswise. This, I think, is
the king of all sutras, because of its myriad applications. With this maths
sutra you can multiply or square numbers and find out the unknowns in a
simultaneous equation. Thatâ€™s the reason I call it the king of all sutras!
Using the vertically and crosswise sutra you can multiply any number by
any number, mentally or in one line. You can do this even left to right or
right to leftâ€”the direction does not matter and you always get the correct
answer if you apply the steps correctly.
So here we go. Letâ€™s see how to multiply two-digit figures by two-digit
figures.

Two-Digit-by-Two-Digit Multiplication
In this type of multiplication we follow a visual pattern of multiplication,
shown by the dots given here. Letâ€™s understand it thoroughly.

Say we have to multiply 12 Ã— 43.
Step 1
We multiply vertically first, as shown by the dots in the illustration.
We multiply 3 Ã— 2 = 6. We get 6 in the unitâ€™s place.
Step 2
We will now multiply crosswise and add the sums as shown in the
figure below.
So here we add (3 Ã— 1) to (4 Ã— 2) = 3 + 8 = 11. We put down 1 in the
tenâ€™s place and carry 1 to the next step.
Step 3
In this final step, we multiply vertically again, but this time we
multiply 4 Ã— 1 = 4. We now add the carry-over 1 with 4, giving us 5 as
our hundredâ€™s place. Our complete answer is 516. Simple?
Letâ€™s explore the pattern deeper.

Step 1
We multiply the units by the unitâ€™s place to arrive at the unitâ€™s place
digit.
Step 2
We now need the tenâ€™s digit. So, to arrive at that, we multiply units by
tens and tens by units as shown in the figure below.
Step 3
To finally arrive at the hundredâ€™s place we multiply the tenâ€™s place by
the tenâ€™s place vertically as shown in the figure here.
Let us take another illustration. Say we have 78 Ã— 69.

Step 1
As shown in the dot diagram here, we first multiply vertically in the
unitâ€™s place. Nine times 8 equals 72. We keep the 2 in the unitâ€™s place
and carry-over 7 to the tenâ€™s place.
Step 2
In our second step, we multiply crosswise as shown here. We do (9 Ã—
7) plus (6 Ã— 8) together. This gives us 63 + 48 = 111. To 111 we add 7,
our carry-over from the previous step, making it 118.
So, as before, we put 8 down in the tenâ€™s place and carry 11 over to the
final step.
Step 3
In our final step, we multiply 6 Ã— 7 giving us 42. We then add 11, our
carry-over from the previous step. 42 + 11 = 53. We put 53 down and
our final answer 5382 is right before us.
So now we have understood how to multiply any two-digit number by
another two-digit number with the help of the maths sutra vertically and
crosswise method. The question now arises what does one do if one has to
multiply any two-digit number by a single-digit figure?
This is nothing but childâ€™s play with the help of our maths sutra,
vertically and crosswise.

Two-Digit-by-One-Digit Multiplication
Say we have to multiply 34 and 8. Letâ€™s take the sum and lay it out just as
before.

Step 1
In our first step, we put a zero before 8. We do this because we want 8
to be a two-digit figure, so that it fits our requirement and we can
apply the vertically and crosswise sutra.
So the sum first looks like this:
Step 2
We apply the vertically and crosswise sutra now. First multiplying 8
and 4 together, we get 32. We put 2 in the unitâ€™s place and carry over 3
to the next step.
In the next step, we simply do the crosswise step. So we have (8 Ã— 3) +
(0 Ã— 4) = 24. To this we add the previous
carry-over, 3. 24 + 3 = 27. We put 7 in the tenâ€™s place and carry over 2
to the next step.
Our sum looks like this now:
Step 3
Vertically is our final step. Here we multiply 0 Ã— 3 = 0. We then add 2
from the previous step to 0, giving us 2. Our answer becomes 272.
Now that we have seen the vertically and crosswise for two digits, itâ€™s time
we learnt the three-digit-by-three-digit multiplication too.

Three-Digit-by-Three-Digit Multiplication
Letâ€™s be a little attentive here in understanding the technique of the three-
digit by three-digit multiplication pattern. This is new and might take a
couple of minutes for anyone to understand. The good news is that we
already know four of the five steps, as done earlier. So we just have to focus
on understanding the pattern inbuilt here.
See the illustration. As always the dots represent the numbers over here.

1) The first step isâ€˜verticallyâ€™. As shown in the illustration, we multiply
vertically the unitâ€™s digit by the other unitâ€™s digit to arrive at the unitâ€™s
digit of our answer.
2) In our second step, we multiply crosswise to arrive at the tenâ€™s place
digit.
3) This is a new step which we can call theâ€˜starâ€™ step, simply because the
pattern looks like a star. In this step, we have to arrive at the hundredâ€™s
place. So we multiply and add as shown here to get to the hundredâ€™s
place.
4) In our fourth step, we multiply crosswise as shown.
5) In our final step, we multiply vertically to arrive at the final answer
figures.

Perfect âœ…!
Let me now convert this entire section into **well-structured notes** with the **Multiples \& Sub-Multiples idea**, the **different bases case**, and finally the **Vertically \& Crosswise Sutra** for 2-digit Ã— 2-digit, 2-digit Ã— 1-digit, and 3-digit Ã— 3-digit multiplication.

# âœ¨ Notes on Multiplication (Multiples, Sub-multiples \& Vertically-Crosswise)


***

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Multiples \& Sub-Multiples of Base

Sometimes numbers are closer to **50, 200, 500**, etc., rather than 10, 100, 1000.
We can still apply the **Base Method**, with a minor adjustment:

### Rule:

- Write deviations from the **working base** (50, 200, â€¦).
- After cross-addition:
    - Multiply LHS by the **factor between working base \& nearest 10^n**.
    - Handle RHS as per **placement rule**.

***

### Example 1: \$ 44 Ã— 48 \$ (near 50)

- Working base = 50 = \$ 10 Ã— 5 \$.
- Deviations: \$ 44 â†’ -6\$, \$ 48 â†’ -2\$.
- Cross: \$ 44 - 2 = 42\$.
- RHS product: $(-6) Ã— (-2) = 12$.
- Adjustment: \$ 42 Ã— 5 = 210\$.
- Base 50 â†’ one zero â†’ RHS = 1 digit. From 12 â†’ take "2", carry "1".
- LHS = 210 + 1 = 211 â†’ Final Answer = **2112**

***

### Example 2: \$ 49 Ã— 47 \$

- Base = 50 â†’ factor 5.
- Deviations: \$ -1, -3 \$.
- Cross: \$ 49 - 3 = 46\$.
- RHS: \$ -1 Ã— -3 = +3\$.
- LHS adjustment: \$ 46 Ã— 5 = 230\$.
- RHS = one digit â†’ 3.

âœ… Answer = **2303**

***

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Different Bases

What if numbers are near **different bases**?

- Example: 981 (near 1000) Ã— 93 (near 100).


### Rule:

1. Find the ratio: (Bigger base Ã· Smaller base).
2. Multiply the smaller number by this ratio.
3. Apply normal base method.
4. Finally, divide the result by the same ratio.

***

### Example 3: \$ 981 Ã— 93 \$

- Bases: 1000 (for 981), 100 (for 93).
- Ratio = \$ 1000 Ã· 100 = 10 \$.
- Adjust: \$ 93 Ã— 10 = 930\$.
- Compute: \$ 981 Ã— 930 = 912330 \$.
- Divide by 10 â†’ **91233**

âœ… Answer = **91233**

***

### Example 4: \$ 1006 Ã— 118 \$

- Bases: 1000 \& 100 â†’ ratio = 10.
- Adjust: \$ 118 Ã— 10 = 1180\$.
- Compute: \$ 1006 Ã— 1180 = 1187080\$.
- Divide by 10 â†’ **118708**

âœ… Answer = **118708**

***

## ðŸ”¹ 3. The Vertically \& Crosswise Sutra

This sutra allows us to multiply **any numbers**, mentally or on paper, using a visual pattern.

***

### ðŸ“˜ A. Two-Digit Ã— Two-Digit

**Steps:**

1. **Vertical (units Ã— units)** â†’ gives RHS (units).
2. **Crosswise (unitsÃ—tens + tensÃ—units)** â†’ gives middle part.
3. **Vertical (tens Ã— tens)** â†’ gives LHS.

***

#### Example 5: \$ 12 Ã— 43 \$

- Step 1: Units â†’ \$ 3 Ã— 2 = 6\$.
- Step 2: Cross â†’ \$ (3 Ã— 1) + (4 Ã— 2) = 3 + 8 = 11\$. Write 1, carry 1.
- Step 3: Tens â†’ \$ 4 Ã— 1 = 4\$. Add carry 1 â†’ 5.

âœ… Answer = **516**

***

#### Example 6: \$ 78 Ã— 69 \$

- Step 1: Units â†’ \$ 9 Ã— 8 = 72\$. Write 2, carry 7.
- Step 2: Cross â†’ \$ (9 Ã— 7) + (6 Ã— 8) = 63 + 48 = 111\$. Add carry 7 â†’ 118. Write 8, carry 11.
- Step 3: Tens â†’ \$ 6 Ã— 7 = 42\$. Add carry 11 â†’ 53.

âœ… Answer = **5382**

***

### ðŸ“˜ B. Two-Digit Ã— One-Digit

Convert the one-digit into two-digits by prefixing a **0**.

***

#### Example 7: \$ 34 Ã— 8 \$

- Write as \$ 34 Ã— 08 \$.
- Step 1: Units â†’ \$ 8 Ã— 4 = 32\$. Write 2, carry 3.
- Step 2: Cross â†’ \$ (8 Ã— 3) + (0 Ã— 4) = 24\$. Add carry 3 â†’ 27. Write 7, carry 2.
- Step 3: Tens Vertical â†’ \$ 0 Ã— 3 = 0\$. Add carry 2 â†’ 2.

âœ… Answer = **272**

***

### ðŸ“˜ C. Three-Digit Ã— Three-Digit

Pattern involves **5 steps**:

1. **Vertical (units Ã— units)**.
2. **Cross (tensÃ—units + unitsÃ—tens)**.
3. **Star step (hundredsÃ—units + tensÃ—tens + unitsÃ—hundreds)**.
4. **Cross (hundredsÃ—tens + tensÃ—hundreds)**.
5. **Vertical (hundreds Ã— hundreds)**.

This follows a symmetric dot/star pattern â€” scalable to larger digits as well.

***

# âœ… Key Takeaways

- **Multiples/Sub-multiples base** â†’ Use the nearest flexible base (50, 200, 500, etc.), then adjust by factor.
- **Different bases** â†’ Scale smaller number, apply method, then divide back.
- **Vertically \& Crosswise Sutra** â†’ Works for ANY multiplication (2-digit, 3-digit, larger), stepwise: Vertical â†’ Cross â†’ Star â†’ Cross â†’ Vertical.
