# Above and Below the Base

Now that we have seen the cases of numbers being below the base and
above the base, we can move on to instances where one number is below
the base and the other number is above the base.

Say, for example, we have 15 √ó 8.
We lay the sum out just as before:
Step 1
Both 15 and 8 are above and below the base of 10. 15 is above 10 by 5,
so we write +5 and 8 is below 10 by 2, so we write -2.
Step 2
We cross-add or subtract as the case may be over here. So we do 15 - 2
= 13. We can also do 8 + 5, which equals 13 as well.
We then multiply vertically +5 and -2 to get -10 on the right-hand side.
Our sum now looks like this:
Step 3
Since we have -10 on the right-hand side, there is no need to panic!
What we need to do is multiply the left-hand side (13) by the base
(10). Thirteen times 10 is 130, and from 130 we subtract the -10.
130 - 10 = 120, which is our final answer.
Let‚Äôs take another set of numbers to understand this better.
Say, we have 17 √ó 9.

Step 1
17 and 9 are above and below the base of 10 respectively. 17 is greater
than 10 by 7, so we write +7 and 9 is below 10 by 1, so we write -1.
Step 2
Now we cross-add or subtract, as the case may be. So we do either 17 -
1 = 16 or 9 + 7 = 16, whichever comes easily to you. So 16 becomes
the first part of our answer.
We then multiply vertically on the right-hand side +7 and -1, giving us
-7.
Step 3
To arrive at the final answer, we multiply the left-hand side by 10 (the
base). So the left-hand side becomes 16 √ó 10 = 160. Now from 160 we
subtract 7, giving us 153, our final and complete answer.
Let‚Äôs take an example of a sum near the base 100. 102 √ó 99, for instance.

Step 1
We lay the sum down just as before. We also write the excess and
deficiency from the base of 100.
Step 2
We now cross-subtract. So we have 102 - 01 = 101 or we can also do
99 + 02 = 101.
We also multiply vertically on the right-hand side. So +02 √ó -01 = -02.
Our sum now looks like this:
Step 3
Here our base is 100. So we multiply 101 by 100 (our base) giving us
From it we subtract 02. So we have 10100 - 02 = 10098, our
final and complete answer.
Now let‚Äôs take an example nearer to the base of 1000.
Say we have 1026 √ó 998.

Step 1
Let‚Äôs lay the sum out just like before and write down the excesses and
deficiencies.
Step 2
We cross-subtract and arrive at the left-hand side part of the answer.
And then we multiply vertically on the right-hand side to get the right-
hand side of the answer.
Step 3
We multiply 1024 by the base 1000 giving us 1024000. From it we
take away -52, giving us 1023948, our final answer.
So till now we have developed an understanding of numbers below the
base, above the base, and above and below the base. Let‚Äôs continue

exploring the concept deeper.

Multiples and Sub-Multiples
I was at IIT Madras giving a talk at their technical fest, Shaastra, and
someone asked me this question: if two numbers are closer to 50 or 200 or
any other multiple of 10, can we still apply the base method?
What do you think the answer could be? Think for a moment or two!
My answer to that question is‚Äòyes!‚Äô We can still apply the base method,
but with a minor adjustment.

Let‚Äôs take an example and see how. Say we have to multiply 44 and 48,
two numbers near to the base 50.

Step 1
We lay out the sum just as before. And write the excesses and
deficiencies from our working base 50. So here we have 44, which is
less than 50 by 6, and 48, which is less than 50 by 2.
Step 2
We now cross-add or subtract as the case may be. So we have our left-
hand side as 44 - 2 = 42 or 48 - 6 = 42. We then multiply vertically -6
and -2 to get 12. Our sum now looks like this:
Step 3
Now since our working base is 50, we have to adjust the sum for this.
Since we get 50 by multiplying 10 and 5, we multiply 42 by 5 to get
210, which is the left-hand side of the answer.
Since our base is 50, which has one zero, the right-hand side should
have one digit. And since there is one digit extra, we add that to the
left-hand side.
210 + 1 = 211 and 2 comes down, giving us the answer of 2112.
Let‚Äôs see some more illustrations of the same principle at work.
Say we have 49 √ó 47.

Step 1
Our working base here is 50 as both 49 and 47 are near to it. Let‚Äôs lay
the sum out and apply the rules learnt in the previous example. We also
write down the excesses or deficiencies as before.
Step 2
Now since the working base is 10 √ó 5 = 50, we multiply the ten‚Äôs place
by 5. So here we multiply 46 (in the ten‚Äôs place) by 5. This gives us
230.
Step 3
Our final step will just be bringing the 3 down and combining it with
230 to make 2303.
Our final answer is 2303.
Let me give you three worked-out sums as illustrations.

# ‚ú® Notes on Multiplication **Above and Below the Base**

We have learned:

1. Multiplication of numbers **below the base**
2. Multiplication of numbers **above the base**

Now we extend it to:

- Cases where **one number is above and the other is below the base**
- Multiplication using **multiples or sub-multiples of base** (like 50, 200, etc.).

***

## üîπ General Rule (Above‚ÄìBelow Base Case)

1. **Identify the base** (nearest 10, 100, 1000‚Ä¶).
2. **Find deviations**:
    - Numbers above the base ‚Üí positives
    - Numbers below the base ‚Üí negatives
3. **Cross-add / cross-subtract**:
    - Add the positive to the other or subtract the negative.
    - This gives the **left-hand part** of the answer.
4. **Multiply deviations vertically**:
    - Positive √ó Negative = Negative.
    - This gives the **right-hand part** of the answer.
5. **Adjustment step** (important):
    - Multiply the left-hand part by the base.
    - Subtract the negative (deficiency product) from it.

***

## üîπ Examples

### Example 1: \$ 15 √ó 8 \$

- Base = 10.
- Deviations: \$ 15 ‚Üí +5 \$, \$ 8 ‚Üí -2 \$.
- Step 2 (Cross): \$ 15 - 2 = 13 \$ (or \$ 8 + 5 = 13 \$).
- Step 3 (Multiply deviations): \$ +5 √ó -2 = -10 \$.
- Adjustment: Left = \$ 13 √ó 10 = 130 \$. Now \$ 130 - 10 = 120 \$.

‚úÖ Answer = **120**

***

### Example 2: \$ 17 √ó 9 \$

- Base = 10.
- Deviations: \$ 17 ‚Üí +7 \$, \$ 9 ‚Üí -1 \$.
- Cross: \$ 17 - 1 = 16\$.
- Deviation multiplication: \$ +7 √ó -1 = -7\$.
- Adjustment: \$ 16 √ó 10 = 160\$. Subtract $7$.

‚úÖ Answer = **153**

***

### Example 3: \$ 102 √ó 99 \$

- Base = 100.
- Deviations: \$ 102 ‚Üí +02 \$, \$ 99 ‚Üí -01 \$.
- Cross: \$ 102 - 1 = 101\$.
- Deviation product: \$ 2 √ó -1 = -02\$.
- Adjustment: \$ 101 √ó 100 = 10100\$. Subtract 02 ‚Üí **10098**.

‚úÖ Answer = **10098**

***

### Example 4: \$ 1026 √ó 998 \$

- Base = 1000.
- Deviations: \$ 1026 ‚Üí +26\$, \$ 998 ‚Üí -2\$.
- Cross: \$ 1026 - 2 = 1024\$.
- Deviation product: \$ 26 √ó -2 = -52\$.
- Adjustment: \$ 1024 √ó 1000 = 1024000\$. Subtract 52 ‚Üí **1023948**.

‚úÖ Answer = **1023948**

***

## üîπ Multiples \& Sub-Multiples of Base

We can also use working bases like **50, 200, 500**, etc.

- Rule: Express working base in terms of a convenient power of 10 multiplied/divided by a factor.
- After cross and deviation multiplication, **multiply the left-hand side by this factor** to adjust.

***

### Example 5: \$ 44 √ó 48 \$ (near base 50)

- Working base = 50 = $10 √ó 5$.
- Deviations: \$ 44 ‚Üí -6\$, $48 ‚Üí -2$.
- Cross: \$ 44 - 2 = 42 \$.
- Product: \$ -6 √ó -2 = 12\$.
- Adjustment: \$ 42 √ó 5 = 210\$.
- Placement: Base = 50 (1 zero ‚Üí RHS has 1 digit).
    - From product 12 ‚Üí take ‚Äú2‚Äù, carry ‚Äú1‚Äù.
    - LHS = 210 + 1 = 211.
    - Combined: **2112**.

‚úÖ Answer = **2112**

***

### Example 6: \$ 49 √ó 47 \$

- Base = 50 = $10 √ó 5$.
- Deviations: \$ 49 ‚Üí -1\$, $47 ‚Üí -3$.
- Cross: \$ 49 - 3 = 46\$.
- Product: $(-1) √ó (-3) = +3$.
- Adjustment: \$ 46 √ó 5 = 230\$.
- Placement: Base = 50 (1 zero ‚Üí RHS = 1 digit). Final = **2303**.

‚úÖ Answer = **2303**

***

### Example (Further practice ‚Äî suggested to try yourself)

- \$ 198 √ó 202 \$ (Base 200)
- \$ 48 √ó 53 \$ (Base 50)
- \$ 495 √ó 505 \$ (Base 500)

(Same method applies: find deviations, cross-add, multiply deviations, and adjust by factor.)

***

# ‚úÖ Summary Sheet

- **Below the Base** ‚Üí Use cross-subtract \& positive products of negative deviations.
- **Above the Base** ‚Üí Use cross-add \& positive products of positive deviations.
- **Above \& Below Base** ‚Üí Cross-add becomes subtract, RHS negative ‚Üí Adjust by multiplying LHS with base, subtract RHS.
- **Multiples \& Sub-multiples** ‚Üí Adjust LHS by multiplying with the base factor (like √ó5 for 50, √ó2 for 200, √ó0.5 for 500, etc.).
